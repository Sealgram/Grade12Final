# RedditBots-CompSciFinal
This code is my computer science grade 12 final, and it is two reddit bots- one that displays user statistics,
and one that displays the weather upon call.
If you want to run the code, just download it and do the pip install, then make a post for your comments on r/BotTraining. The bots will only respond to their ketphrases and commands when the script is running. Weatherbot may error out as he does not have enough Karma to infinitely request from the reddit API.

## Pip installs required:
```
pip install praw
```

### StatsBot Commands:
```
!!stats Karma
!!stats Comments
!!stats Trophies
```

### Weatherbot Command:
```
!!weather [city]
```
